Alright let's work on the Third layer: the agents made enough money we can just switch to trading over coding and tasks

For now you will build a standalone artifact to prototype it, then we'll integrate in the current game as the tab 3 where you trade, between tab 2 where you manage agents, and tab 4 where you acquire and run businesses

## MiniGame specs

- A trading engine which ticks and random walks the various kinds of ticker values

- An UI split vertically in two: show on the left controls and upgrade options, and show on the right a nice currency chart ticker with a cyberpunk terminal feel where you see values go up in neon green or down in neon orange, you can select a value among those unlocked, and buy/sell 1/10/100/Max  

  - In the left control panel, for now put upgrades and any useful control to manage trading

    - Upgrades: at first you can only trade memecoins, you can buy diff types of upgrades

      - Unlocks of new values to trade:

          - Unlock ForEx trading (underlying engine tracks each currency as a ticker, but you trade on pairs)

          - Unlock Cryptocurrencies (proper ones: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc)

          - then Unlock Futures (on basic commodities) - when you unlock futures you have an UI upgrade with long term view and ability to zoom in and out timeline

          - finally Unlock Stocks ($APPL $TSLA $GOOG $ADBE $DOOZ $PARV $APP $HACK $NEXT $ROFL)

      - Upgrade Resolution [1/2/3/4/5]: you now see the right price chart tick at the faster hour/minute/second/millisecond/nanosecond rate (when trading is manual change is only cosmetic, but this rate will affect trading agent rate of revenue)

      - Upgrade Trading Agent: now we're in business, you can assign managers to the trading. mark the upgrade effect as TODO for now we'll come back to ita

  - In the right control pane, at first you see just an evolving price chart where the price appears as the engine computes each value tick (represented as 1 day initially), it has bottom tabs and displays a single active tab "Memecoins" at first, you add types of assets as they are unlocked in new tabs below (place them with ??? each first)

  Awesome now a few improvements:
  * Add a red debug button bottom left, on press adds 1B money
  * Can you make the charts segmented by up/down segments, so the colors display rising and descending prices as time goes
  * The chart shows 3/1 always, it should track the current day over a 365 year, in the european "28/02" day/month format
  * When moving to hourly, it should show hours in EU format too, from 00:00 to 23:00
  * minutes, over a day too, but now from 00:00 to 23:59
  * seconds, over a minute only, so 00-59
  * millis and nanos, from 0 to 1000, but full second comma format: "0,001s" to "0,999s" or "0,000,0001s"  etc
  * Bias the first stock: it should overall rise by 5% every 100 ticks, and when you have less than 1000$ cash, by 25% overall (but random walk still makes it not obvious)

# 2 
There's a bug in the Charts, the segments are all starting from the left wall, so they all are mingled. Check their X positioning, if you can't fix this, consider a more trading-native approach to this charting task
  
# 3
This points approach is cleaner, but I see red/green segments on the vertical axis left side, remove these at all now we have the points on dashed line it's quite cool as is. Make sure as the chart refreshes on the right, you recycle/delete items on the left, it must run smooth forever

# 4 
I think there's still an issue, I see full line segments accumulate left of screen
Chart legend is also still stuck when in days, it's still always same 01/03? , when I move to hourly it's also stuck at 01:00 on each new X line entry, but once in minutes I saw 01:06, and once in seconds I see the expected 31/32/33/etc, however I sometimes see several entries in the line with same sec value, and milliseconds entries are changing instead of being fixed but each a millisecond more, fix that

# 5
milliseconds should increment by 1, from the 0,001s to the 0,999s
trading agent purchase adds a bar below chart, split vertical in two: Agent controls (Strategy select, "Buy" toggle, "Sell " toggle) and Agent Log (a console.log like list of actions the agent did, scrolling to always display last entry, scrollable but fixed height to not take too much space)
Agent tracks values over a "full loop" (month in daily resolution, day in hourly resolution, etc, and buy at cheapest
When "Buy" is toggled on, agent buys values over next loop and buys when under that previous lowest value
When "Sell" is on, similar logic try to sell as much as possible but only if under previous min
Strategies are new upgrades you can buy, for now a single one is selected: "Just Track Prices", which requires you toggle the buttons yourself

Error running artifact
An error occurred while trying to run the generated artifact.
* hasAgent is not defined

Also can you make debug slightly more discreet, maybe just outline colored?
Also reorganize upgrade prices so people can buy hourly, then trading agent, before lower resolutions Also if you see dull wording make it a bit funnier, tone is cyberpunk blasé néo-noir with a hint of Terry Pratchett

# XXX

Add a Hacking To The Moon upgrade: when purchased, a new Agent control appears: every 30s of real time, user can click that button, see a modal to choose a value from owned assets, and it gets now pinned to its ever historical max.

Another more expensive: Hacking To The Ground, does the opposite: hack to lower value any (owned or unowned this time!) unlocked asset, and then inactive for 30s too.
