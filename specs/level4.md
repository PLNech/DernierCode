# Level 4 : PropagandAI

Pitch: you made enough cryptos on level 3 to buy a datacenter. 
With this you mine enough Bitcoins to control the ledger.
With this, you own your first two states.

Especially those with the Crypto reserves. They thought that makes independent of the mighty dollar? 
Yes, but there's a but, a shiny metal one.

Goal: Control the planetary opinion, building influence country by country.

UI Style: World Map like Risk Game (consistent with our overall game style, discrete cyberpunk neo-noir)
where you see countries, the ones you control are highlighted, starting with the two you bought reserves from
when you started mining more than 50% of BitCoins in your datacenter : Venezuela and Argentina.

Game engine:
- System ticks days clock, with one day every 5 second.


Actions:
- You can generate fakes with LLMs, starting with the datacenter you bought at end of level 3
  - At first, you can only do text
  - You can only affect the countries you control, or neighbors

Upgrades:
  - ImaGen models: you're starting to generate image fakes too, very powerful
  - DeepFake Videos: we're in business now
  - DeepFake Hologram Avatar: you can see me, but "Can't touch me"


UI: 
- Main view is the map, full screen
- On country click, you see a 4/5 core screen:
  - this core country view is split vertically in two:  
    - left the focused map on selected highlighted country, you still see neighboring borders
    - right the Population Diagram, a star chart with 5 dimensions:
      - [P] Politics 
      - [M] Media
      - [C] Population Control
      - [T] Public Trust
      - [D] Diplomacy
  - the last 1/5 bottom of the screen is filled with the Country TaskBar:
    - 


- Coutries
